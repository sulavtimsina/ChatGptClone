## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
com.sulav.chatgptclone
‚îú‚îÄ data/ # Room + DataStore
‚îú‚îÄ repository/ # Single source of truth, streaming logic
‚îú‚îÄ ui/ # Compose UI (chat, voice, history, components)
‚îú‚îÄ viewmodel/ # Hilt-injected ViewModels (MVVM)
‚îú‚îÄ utils/ # Clipboard, TTS, NetworkMonitor, Markdown
‚îî‚îÄ di/ # Hilt modules

* Clean MVVM with unidirectional `StateFlow`  
* Repository streams LLM tokens ‚Üí Room ‚Üí ViewModel observes ‚Üí UI renders  
* **ConfigurableAiService** picks **RealAiService** or **FakeAiService** based on DataStore flag

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ChatGPTClone.git
```

2. **Secrets**

Create (or append) local.properties:

```properties
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

3. **Run**

```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

4. **Fake vs Real LLM**
Toggle between Fake ‚ÜîÔ∏é OpenAI
Open the drawer ‚ûú switch ‚ÄúUse Live LLM‚Äù.

## üü° Remaining TODO / Known Limitations

| Area | Item |
|------|------|
| **International-ization** | Several UI strings are still hard-coded in code (e.g., ‚ÄúAsk anything‚Äù, icon contentDescriptions). Move them to **`strings.xml`** for full i18n support. |
| **Threading** | Repository network/DB work already runs on `Dispatchers.IO`, but a final audit is needed to ensure **zero** main-thread blocking. |
| **Lifecycle clean-up** | ‚Ä¢ Release `TextToSpeech` with `shutdown()` in `onCleared()`.<br>‚Ä¢ Call `SpeechRecognizer.cancel()` when Voice screen closes to guarantee mic is freed. |
| **Networking** | Add explicit OkHttp `callTimeout()` (e.g., 60 s) to avoid hanging coroutines if OpenAI stalls. |
| **ProGuard / R8** | Insert keep-rules for `android.speech.*` to prevent reflection stripping in release builds. |
| **Accessibility** | Provide `contentDescription` for all interactive icons (send, mic, copy, play). |
| **Crash / Analytics** | No runtime crash reporting (Crashlytics/Sentry) integrated yet. |
| **Amplitude-Driven Equalizer** | Current AI waveform is animated, but uses synthetic amplitude‚Äînot real PCM RMS from TTS (Android API limitation). |
| **Offline Sync** | Messages queued offline are stored locally but **not auto-retried** once connection returns. |

## Known Limitations
- No automatic retry queue for offline messages yet
- **TTS amplitude is approximated (Android doesn‚Äôt expose live PCM RMS)**
- Image markdown not rendered
